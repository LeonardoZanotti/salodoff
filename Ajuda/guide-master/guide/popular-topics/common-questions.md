# Common questions

## Legend

* `<client>` is a placeholder for the Client object, such as `const client = new Discord.Client();`.
* `<message>` is a placeholder for the Message object, such as `client.on('message', message => { ... });`.
* `<guild>` is a placeholder for the Guild object, such as `<message>.guild` or `<client>.guilds.get('<id>')`.

## Bot Configuration

### How do I set my username?

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```js
<client>.user.setUsername('<username>');
```

### How do I set my avatar?

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```js
<client>.user.setAvatar('<url or path>');
```

### How do I set my playing status?

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```js
<client>.user.setActivity('<activity>');
```

### How do I set my status to "Watching ..." or "Listening to ..."?

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```js
<client>.user.setActivity('<activity>', { type: 'WATCHING' });
<client>.user.setActivity('<activity>', { type: 'LISTENING' });
```

<branch version="11.x">

::: tip
If you would like to set your activity upon startup, you must place the `<client>.user.setActivity()` method in a `ready` event listener (`<client>.on('ready', () => {});`).
:::

::: warning
`<client>.user.setActivity()` will only work in v11.3 and above. You can check your version with `npm ls discord.js` and update with `npm install discord.js`. You can still use `<client>.user.setGame()`, but it is deprecated as of v11.3, and has been removed in v12.

<branch version="12.x">

::: tip
If you would like to set your activity upon startup, you can use the `ClientOptions` object to set the appropriate `Presence` data.

## Miscellaneous

### How do I send a message to a certain channel?

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```js
const channel = <client>.channels.get('<id>');
channel.send('<content>');
```

### How do I DM a certain user?

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```js
const user = <client>.users.get('<id>');
user.send('<content>');
```

::: tip
If you want to DM the user who sent the message, you can use `<message>.author.send()`.
:::

### How do I tag a certain user in a message?

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```js
const user = <message>.mentions.users.first();
<message>.channel.send(`Hi, ${user}.`);
<message>.channel.send('Hi, <@user id>.');
```

::: tip
If you want to tag the user who sent the message, you can use `<message>.reply()`. For example: `<message>.reply('hi.')` would result in `@User, hi.`. If you want to insert the tag elsewhere, you can store `<message>.author` as your `user` variable and use the original example.
:::

::: tip
Tags inside certain areas of an embed may display correctly, but will not actually ping the user. Tags inside other certain areas of an embed will display the raw string instead (e.g. `<@123456789012345678>`).
:::

### How do I prompt the user for additional input?

<branch version="11.x">

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```js
<message>.channel.send('Please enter more input.').then(() => {
	const filter = m => <message>.author.id === m.author.id;

	<message>.channel.awaitMessages(filter, { time: 60000, maxMatches: 1, errors: ['time'] })
		.then(messages => {
			<message>.channel.send(`You've entered: ${messages.first().content}`);
		})
		.catch(() => {
			<message>.channel.send('You did not enter any input!');
		});
});
```

</branch>
<branch version="12.x">

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```js
<message>.channel.send('Please enter more input.').then(() => {
	const filter = m => <message>.author.id === m.author.id;

	<message>.channel.awaitMessages(filter, { time: 60000, max: 1, errors: ['time'] })
		.then(messages => {
			<message>.channel.send(`You've entered: ${messages.first().content}`);
		})
		.catch(() => {
			<message>.channel.send('You did not enter any input!');
		});
});
```

### How do I react to the message my bot sent?

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```js
<message>.channel.send('My message to react to.').then(sentMessage => {
	sentMessage.react('üëç');
	sentMessage.react('<emoji id>');
});
```

### How do I create a restart command?

```js
process.exit();
```

::: tip
`process.exit()` will only kill your Node process, but when using [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/), it will restart the process whenever it gets killed. You can read our guide on PM2 [here](/improving-dev-environment/pm2.md).
:::

::: warning
Be sure to [limit this to your own ID](/popular-topics/common-questions.md#how-do-i-limit-a-command-to-a-single-user) so that other users can't restart your bot!

### What is the difference between a User and a GuildMember?

A lot of users get confused as to what the difference between Users and GuildMembers is. The simple answer is that a User represents a global Discord user and a GuildMember represents a Discord user on a specific server. That means only GuildMembers can have permissions, roles, and nicknames, for example, because all of these things are server-bound information that could be different on each server that user is in.

### How do I find all online members?

Assuming the process is to be done for the guild the message is sent in.

<branch version="11.x">

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```js
// First we use fetchMembers to make sure all members are cached
<message>.guild.fetchMembers().then(fetchedGuild => {
	const totalOnline = fetchedGuild.members.filter(member => member.presence.status === 'online');
	// We now have a collection with all online member objects in the totalOnline variable
	<message>.channel.send(`There are currently ${totalOnline.size} members online in this guild!`);
});
```

</branch>
<branch version="12.x">

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```js
// First we use guild.members.fetch to make sure all members are cached
<message>.guild.members.fetch().then(fetchedMembers => {
	const totalOnline = fetchedMembers.filter(member => member.presence.status === 'online');
	// We now have a collection with all online member objects in the totalOnline variable
	<message>.channel.send(`There are currently ${totalOnline.size} members online in this guild!`);
});
```

</branch>

### How do I check which role was added/removed, and for which member?

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```js
// We start by declaring a guildMemberUpdate listener
// This code should be placed outside of any other listener callbacks to prevent listener nesting
<client>.on('guildMemberUpdate', (oldMember, newMember) => {
	// If the role(s) are present on the old member object but no longer on the new one (i.e role(s) were removed)
	const removedRoles = oldMember.roles.filter(role => !newMember.roles.has(role.id));
	if(removedRoles.size > 0) console.log(`The roles ${removedRoles.map(r => r.name)} were added to ${oldMember.displayName}.`);
	// If the role(s) are present on the new member object but are not on the new one (i.e role(s) were added)
	const addedRoles = newMember.roles.filter(role => !oldMember.roles.has(role.id));
	if(addedRoles.size > 0) console.log(`The roles ${addedRoles.map(r => r.name)} were removed from ${oldMember.displayName}.`);
});
```
