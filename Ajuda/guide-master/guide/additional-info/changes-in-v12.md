# Updating from v11 to v12

After a long time in development, Discord.js v12 is nearing a stable release, meaning it's time to update from v11 to get new features for your bots!  However, with those new features comes a lot of changes to the library that will break code written for v11.  This guide will serve as a handy reference for updating your code, covering the most commonly-used methods that have been changed, new topics such as partials and internal sharding, and will also include a comprehensive list of the method and property changes at the end.

## Before You Start

v12 requires Node 10.x or higher to  use, so make sure you're up-to-date.  To check your Node version, use `node -v` in your terminal or command prompt, and if it's not high enough, update it!  There are many resources online to help you get up-to-date.

For now, you do need Git installed and added to your PATH environment, so ensure that's done as well - again, guides are available online for a wide variety of operating systems.  Once you have Node up-to-date and Git installed, you can install v12 by running `npm install discordjs/discord.js` in your terminal or command prompt for text-only use, or `npm install discordjs/discord.js node-opus` for voice support.

## Commonly Used Methods That Changed

* All section headers are named in the following convention: `Class#methodOrProperty`.
* The use of parenthesis designates optional inclusion. For example, `Channel#fetch(Pinned)Message(s)` means that this section will include changes for `Channel#fetchPinnedMessages`, `Channel#fetchMessages`, and `Channel#fetchMessage`.
* The use of asterisks designates a wildcard. For example, `Channel#send***` means that this section will include changes for `Channel#sendMessage`, `Channel#sendFile`, `Channel#sendEmbed`, and so forth.

### Collection

#### Collection#exists

`collection.exists()` was removed entirely, `collection.some()` should be used to check if an element exists in the collection that satisfies the provided value.

```diff
- client.users.exists('username', 'Bob');
+ client.users.some(user => user.username === 'Bob');
```

#### Collection#filterArray

`collection.filterArray()` was removed entirely, as it was just a helper method for `collection.filter().array()` and most of the time converting a collection to an array is an unnecessary step.

#### Collection#find

`collection.find('property', value)` has been removed entirely, and `collection.find()` only accepts a function in v12.

```diff
- client.users.find('username', 'Bob');
+ client.users.find(user => user.username === 'Bob');
```

#### Collection#findAll

`collection.findAll()` was removed entirely as it just duplicated `collection.filterArray()`'s results.

### Fetch

Some methods that retrieve uncached data have been changed, transformed in the shape of a DataStore.

```diff
- client.fetchUser('123456789012345678');
+ client.users.fetch('123456789012345678');

- guild.fetchMember('123456789012345678');
+ guild.members.fetch('123456789012345678');

- guild.fetchMembers();
+ guild.members.fetch();

- textChannel.fetchMessage('123456789012345678');
+ textChannel.messages.fetch('123456789012345678');

- textChannel.fetchMessages({ limit: 10 });
+ textChannel.messages.fetch({ limit: 10 });

- textChannel.fetchPinnedMessages();
+ textChannel.messages.fetchPinned();
```

### Send

All the `.send***()` methods have been removed in favor of one general `.send()` method.

```diff
- channel.sendMessage('Hey!');
+ channel.send('Hey!');

- channel.sendEmbed(embedVariable);
+ channel.send(embedVariable);
+ channel.send({ embed: embedVariable });
```

`channel.send(embedVariable)` will only work if that variable is an instance of the `MessageEmbed` class; object literals won't give you the expected result unless your embed data is inside an `embed` key.

```diff
- channel.sendCode('js', 'const version = 11;');
+ channel.send('const version = 12;', { code: 'js' });

- channel.sendFile('./file.png');
- channel.sendFiles(['./file-one.png', './file-two.png']);
+ channel.send({
	files: [{
		attachment: 'entire/path/to/file.jpg',
		name: 'file.jpg'
	}]
+ channel.send({
	files: ['https://cdn.discordapp.com/icons/222078108977594368/6e1019b3179d71046e463a75915e7244.png?size=2048']
});
```

### Roles

The `GuildMember.roles` Collection has been changed to a DataStore in v12, so a lot of the associated methods for interacting with a member's roles have changed as well.  They're no longer on the GuildMember object itself, but instead now on the `GuildMemberRoleStore` DataStore.

```diff
- guildMember.addRole('123456789012345678');
- guildMember.addRoles(['123456789012345678', '098765432109876543']);
+ guildMember.roles.add('123456789012345678');
+ guildMember.roles.add(['123456789012345678', '098765432109876543']);

- guildMember.removeRole('123456789012345678');
- guildMember.removeRoles(['123456789012345678', '098765432109876543']);
+ guildMember.roles.remove('123456789012345678');
+ guildMember.roles.remove(['123456789012345678', '098765432109876543']);

- guildMember.setRoles(['123456789012345678', '098765432109876543']);
+ guildMember.roles.set(['123456789012345678', '098765432109876543']);
```

In addition, the GuildMember properties related to roles have also been moved to the `GuildMemberRoleStore` DataStore.

```diff
- guildMember.colorRole;
+ guildMember.roles.color;

- guildMember.highestRole;
+ guildMember.roles.highest;

- guildMember.hoistRole;
+ guildMember.roles.hoist;
```

### Ban and Unban

The method to ban members and users have been moved to the `GuildMemberStore` Data Store.

```diff
- guild.ban('123456789012345678');
+ guild.members.ban('123456789012345678');

- guild.unban('123456789012345678');
+ guild.members.unban('123456789012345678');
```

### Image URLs

Some image-related properties like `user.avatarURL` are now a method in v12, so that you can apply some options to them, eg. to affect their display size.

```diff
- user.avatarURL;
+ user.avatarURL();

- user.displayAvatarURL;
+ user.displayAvatarURL();

- guild.iconURL;
+ guild.iconURL();

- guild.splashURL;
+ guild.splashURL();
```

### RichEmbed Constructor

The RichEmbed constructor has been removed and now the `MessageEmbed` constructor is used.  It is largely the same to use, the only difference being the removal of `RichEmbed.attachFile()` - `MessageEmbed.attachFiles()` accepts a single file as a parameter as well.

### String Concatenation

v12 has changed how string concatenation works with stringifying objects.  The `valueOf` any data structure will return its id, which affects how it behaves in strings, eg. using an object for a mention.  In v11, you used to be able to use `channel.send(userObject + ' has joined!')` and it would automatically stringify the object and it would become the mention (`@user has joined!`), but in v12, it will now send a message that says `123456789012345678 has joined` instead.  Using template literals (\`\`) will still return the mention, however.

```diff
- channel.send(userObject + ' has joined!')
+ channel.send(`${userObject} has joined!`)
```

### User Account-Only Methods

All user account-only methods have been removed, as they are no longer publicly accessible from the API.

### Voice

v12 has a new voice system that improves stability but also comes with some changes to playing audio:

```diff
# Applies to VoiceConnection and VoiceBroadcast
- connection.playFile('file.mp3')
+ connection.play('file.mp3')

- connection.playStream(stream)
+ connection.play(stream)

- connection.playArbitraryInput(input)
+ connection.play(input)

- connection.playBroadcast(broadcast)
+ connection.play(broadcast)

- connection.playOpusStream(stream)
+ connection.play(stream, { type: 'opus' })

- connection.playConvertedStream(stream)
+ connection.play(stream, { type: 'converted' })
```

You can now also play Ogg Opus files or WebM Opus files directly without the need for FFmpeg in v12:

```js
connection.play(fs.createReadStream('file.ogg'), { type: 'ogg/opus' });
connection.play(fs.createReadStream('file.webm'), { type: 'webm/opus' });
```

It is also possible to define initial values for `plp`, `fec` and `bitrate` when playing a stream. Minus bitrate, these are new configurable options in v12 that can help when playing audio on unstable network connections.

```diff
- connection.playStream(stream).setBitrate(96)
+ connection.play(stream, { bitrate: 96 })
```

If you don't want to alter the volume of a stream while you're playing it, you can disable volume to improve performance. This cannot be reverted during playback.

```js
connection.play(stream, { volume: false });
```

The internal voice system in v12 now uses streams where possible, and as such StreamDispatcher itself is now a WritableStream. It also comes with new changes:

```diff
- dispatcher.end()
+ dispatcher.destroy()

- dispatcher.on('end', handler)
+ dispatcher.on('finish', handler)
```

You can manually control how many audio packets should be queued before playing audio for more consistent playback using the `highWaterMark` option (defaults to 12)
```js
connection.play(stream, { highWaterMark: 512 });
```

If you're frequently pausing/resuming an audio stream, you can enable playing silence packets while paused to prevent audio glitches on the Discord client
```js
// Passing true plays silence
dispatcher.pause(true);
```

#### Broadcasts

Broadcasts themselves now contain a `BroadcastDispatcher` that shares a similar interface to the `StreamDispatcher` and can be used to control the playback of an audio stream.

```diff
- client.createVoiceBroadcast()
+ client.voice.createBroadcast()

- broadcast.dispatchers
+ broadcast.subscribers
```

::: danger
This stuff should keep getting shoved to the bottom, with the commonly-used methods that are changed, as well as topic overviews added before it.
:::

The section headers for breaking changes will be named after the v11 classes/methods/properties and will be in alphabetical order, so that you can easily find what you're looking for. The section headers for additions will be named after the v12 classes/methods/properties, to reflect their current syntax appropriately.

"Difference" codeblocks will be used to display the old methods vs the newer ones—the red being what's been removed and the green being its replacement. Some bits may have more than one version of being handled. Regular JavaScript syntax codeblocks will be used to display the additions.

Stuff Mark didn't do:

* MessageAttachment

### Dependencies

#### Snekfetch

Please note that `snekfetch` has been removed as a dependency, and has been replaced by `node-fetch`.  `snekfetch` has been deprecated by its developer and is no longer maintained.

### Attachment

The `Attachment` class has been removed in favor of the `MessageAttachment` class.

### Client

#### Client#fetchUser

`client.fetchUser()` has been removed and transformed in the shape of a DataStore.

```diff
- client.fetchUser('123456789012345678');
+ client.users.fetch('123456789012345678');
```

#### Client#broadcasts

`client.broadcasts` has been removed and is now in the `ClientVoiceManager` class.

```diff
- client.broadcasts;
+ client.voice.broadcasts;
```

#### Client#browser

`client.browser` has been changed to be an internal constant and is no longer available publicly.

#### Client#channels

`client.channels` has been changed from a Collection to a DataStore.

#### Client#clientUserGuildSettingsUpdate

The `client.clientUserGuildSettingsUpdate` event has been removed entirely, along with all other user account-only properties and methods.

#### Client#clientUserSettingsUpdate

The `client.clientUserSettingsUpdate` event has been removed entirely, along with all other user account-only properties and methods.

#### Client#disconnect

The `client.disconnect` event has been removed in favor of the `client.shardDisconnected` event to make use of internal sharding.

```diff
- client.on('disconnect', event => {});
+ client.on('shardDisconnected', (event, shardID) => {});
```

#### Client#emojis

`client.emojis` has been changed from a Collection to a DataStore.

#### Client#guildMemberSpeaking

The `speaking` parameter has been changed from a `boolean` value to a read-only `Speaking` class.

#### Client#guilds

`client.guilds` has been changed from a Collection to a DataStore.

#### Client#ping

`client.ping` has been moved to the WebSocketManager under `client.ws.ping`

```diff
- client.ping
+ client.ws.ping
```

#### Client#pings

`client.pings` has been moved to the `WebSocketShard` class to make use of internal sharding.  The `Client` class has a `Collection` of `WebSocketShard`s available via `client.ws.shards`; alternatively, the `WebSocketShard` can be found as a property of other structures, eg `guild.shard`.

```diff
- client.pings;
+ guild.shard.pings;
```

#### Client#presences

`client.presences` has been removed to reduce extraneous getters.

#### Client#reconnecting

The `client.reconnecting` event has been removed in favor of the `client.shardReconnecting` event to make use of internal sharding.

```diff
- client.on('reconnecting', () => console.log('Successfully reconnected.'));
+ client.on('shardReconnecting', id => console.log(`Shard with ID ${id} reconnected.`));
```

#### Client#resume

The `client.resume` event has been removed in favor of the `client.shardResumed` event to make use of internal sharding.

```diff
- client.on('resume', replayed => console.log(`Resumed connection and replayed ${replayed} events.`));
+ client.on('shardResumed', (replayed, shardID) => console.log(`Shard ID ${shardID} resumed connection and replayed ${replayed} events.`));
```

#### Client#status

The `client.status` property has been removed and is now in the `WebSocketManager` class.  In addition, it is no longer a getter.

```diff
- client.status;
+ client.ws.status;
```

#### Client#syncGuilds

`client.syncGuilds()` has been removed entirely, along with all other user account-only properties and methods.

#### Client#typingStop

The `client.typingStop` event has been removed entirely, as it was an event created by the library and not an actual Discord WebSocket event.

#### Client#userNoteUpdate

The `client.userNoteUpdate` event has been removed entirely, along with all other user account-only properties and methods.

#### Client#users

`client.users` has been changed from a Collection to a DataStore.

#### Client#voiceConnections

`client.voiceConnections` has been removed and is now in the `ClientVoiceManager` class.  In addition, the `Collection` is no longer a getter.

```diff
- client.voiceConnections;
+ client.voice.connections;
```

#### Client#voiceStateUpdate

The `client.voiceStateUpdate` event now returns `oldState` and `newState` representing the `VoiceState` of the member before and after the update, as opposed to the member itself.

```diff
- client.on('voiceStateUpdate', (oldMember, newMember) => console.log(oldMember));
+ client.on('voiceStateUpdate', (oldState, newState) => console.log(oldState));
```

### ClientOptions

There have been several changes made to the `ClientOptions` object located in `client#options`.

#### ClientOptions#apiRequestMethod

`clientOptions.apiRequestMethod` has been made sequential and is used internally.

#### ClientOptions#shardId

`clientOptions.shardId` has been changed to `clientOptions.shards` and now also accepts an array of numbers.

```diff
- options.shardId: 1
+ options.shards: [1, 2, 3]
```

#### ClientOptions#shards

`clientOptions.shards` has been removed and is functionally equivalent to `clientOptions.totalShardCount` on v12.

#### ClientOptions#sync

`clientOptions.sync` has been removed entirely, along with all other user account-only properties and methods.

### ClientUser

#### ClientUser#acceptInvite

`clientUser.acceptInvite()` has been removed entirely, along with all other user account-only properties and methods.

#### ClientUser#addFriend

`clientUser.addFriend()` has been removed entirely, along with all other user account-only properties and methods.

#### ClientUser#avatarURL

`clientUser.avatarURL` is now a method, as opposed to a property. It also allows you to determine the file format and size to return.

```diff
- clientUser.avatarURL;
+ clientUser.avatarURL();
+ clientUser.avatarURL({ format: 'png', size: 1024 });
```

#### ClientUser#block

`clientUser.block()` has been removed entirely, along with all other user account-only properties and methods.

#### ClientUser#blocked

`clientUser.blocked` has been removed entirely, along with all other user account-only properties and methods.

#### ClientUser#createGuild

`clientUser.createGuild()` has been transformed in the shape of a DataStore.  In addition, the second and third parameters in `clientUser.createGuild()` have been changed/removed, leaving it with a total of two parameters. The `region` and `icon` parameters from v11 have been merged into an object as the second parameter.

```diff
- clientUser.createGuild('New server', 'us-east', './path/to/file.png');
+ clientUser.guilds.create('New server', { region: 'us-east', icon: './path/to/file.png' });
```

#### ClientUser#displayAvatarURL

`clientUser.displayAvatarURL` is now a method, as opposed to a property. It also allows you to determine the file format and size to return.

```diff
- clientUser.displayAvatarURL;
+ clientUser.displayAvatarURL();
+ clientUser.displayAvatarURL({ format: 'png', size: 1024 });
```

#### ClientUser#email

`clientUser.email` has been removed entirely, along with all other user account-only properties and methods.

#### ClientUser#fetchMentions

#### ClientUser#friends

`clientUser.friends` has been removed entirely, along with all other user account-only properties and methods.

#### ClientUser#guildSettings

`clientUser.guildSettings` has been removed entirely, along with all other user account-only properties and methods.

#### ClientUser#notes

`clientUser.notes` has been removed entirely, along with all other user account-only properties and methods.

#### ClientUser#premium

`clientUser.premium` has been removed entirely, along with all other user account-only properties and methods.

#### ClientUser#removeFriend

`clientUser.removeFriend()` has been removed entirely, along with all other user account-only properties and methods.

#### ClientUser#send\*\*\*

Just like the `TextChannel#send***` methods, all the `.send***()` methods have been removed in favor of one general `.send()` method. Read through the [TextChannel#send\*\*\*](/additional-info/changes-in-v12.md#channelsend) section for more information.

#### ClientUser#setGame

`clientUser.setGame()` has been changed to `clientUser.setActivity()`. The second parameter is no longer for providing a streaming URL, but rather an object that allows you to provide the URL and activity type.

```diff
- clientUser.setGame('with my bot friends!');
+ clientUser.setActivity('with my bot friends!');

- clientUser.setGame('with my bot friends!', 'https://twitch.tv/your/stream/here');
+ clientUser.setActivity('with my bot friends!', { url: 'https://twitch.tv/your/stream/here', type: 'STREAMING' });
```

#### ClientUser#setNote

#### Guild#defaultChannel

Unfortunately, "default" channels don't exist in Discord anymore, and as such, the `guild.defaultChannel` property has been removed with no alternative.

**Q:** "I previously had a welcome message system (or something similar) set up using that property. What can I do now?"

**A:** There are a few ways to tackle this. Using the example of a welcome message system, you can:

1. Set up a database table to store the channel ID in a column when someone uses a `!welcome-channel #channel-name` command, for example. Then inside the `guildMemberAdd` event, use `client.channels.get('id')` and send a message to that channel. This is the most reliable method and gives server staff freedom to rename the channel as they please.
2. Make a new command that creates a `welcome-messages` channel, use `guild.channels.find(channel => channel.name === 'welcome-messages')`, and send a message to that channel. This method will work fine in most cases, but will break if someone on that server decides to rename the channel. This may also give you unexpected results, due to Discord allowing multiple channels to have the same name.
