This is a Discord bot in javascript (node.js). The code is free to view and anyone can study him to use in theirs bots.

I use an index to the main code, a commands and events handler to organize my code and some json files for some commands.
In the "Ajuda" folder are anothers discord bots that i have to see their codes to make this bot.
My bot is on Discloud server, a free host of discord bots.
